#
# summary: script to store/retrieve files to/from encrypted folder
# 
# This script mounts a encrypted drive at specified path and copy your files to the  
# encrypted drive, and unmounts it. Optionally with -l option, it simply does a directory 
# listing of the encrypted files as well as -m causes to stay mounted for a period of time. 
# The script will create two directories (encrypted, decrypted) on drive/path if they don't 
# exist. The 'encrypted' directory contains the encrpted files which you can backup to any 
# backup mediums (external drive, even cloud backup like google drive, dropbox etc safely) 
# for safe keeping. To access the encrupted data when needed, you can run this script with 
# -m option which mounts a 'decrypted' directory through the encfs driver to expose them as 
# as normal files inside that directory note: it automatically unmounts after 5 minutes but you 
# can, optionaly set a longer or shorter time with -i option. On MacOS, when the decrypted drive
# is in mounted state, you will have a mounted drive icon on your desktop for conveniently 
# copying your files to the drive while it is in mounted state. On the first time use of this
# script on a specific drive/path, it will ask you to choose a passphrase to encrypt files, 
# make sure you remember that because you need that later when you want to access the encrypted drive.

#
# Instructions for installing encfs
#
#   MacOS (before Catalina): 
#     brew cask install osxfuse
#     brew install encfs
#
#   MacOS (after Catalina):
#     brew install macfuse
#     brew install gromgit/fuse/encfs-mac
#   
#   Linux:
#     Ubuntu/Debian: apt-get install encfs
#     Redhat/CentOS: yum install encfs  
#     Other: refer to your distro manual
#
#   Windows:
#      Sorry, wipe that junk and install Linux or buy a Mac!
#
# NOTE: Change the default enc_drive below to your drive/path before using this script.
