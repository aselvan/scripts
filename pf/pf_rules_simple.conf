# pf_rule_simple.conf - Simple PF (packet filter) rules for basic firewall.
#
# This rule set can be used on-demand with pfctl to enable firewall 
# to protect mac while connected on a public network. There is an 
# anchor setup to allow inserting additional sources to allow trusted
# IPs on the fly.
# 
# NOTE: From Yosemite OS onwards, ipfw is no logner supported so and we
#       have to use PF (pfctl) to setup firewall.
