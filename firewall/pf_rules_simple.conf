# pf_rule_simple.conf - Simple PF (packet filter) rules for basic firewall.
#
# This rule set can be used on-demand with pfctl to enable firewall 
# to protect mac while connected on a public network. There is an 
# anchor setup to allow inserting additional sources to allow trusted
# IP/CIDRs on the fly. Also, it can be installed (see install howto below)
# to start on boot. The 'firewall' shell script can be used to start/stop
# the firewall on demand (see firewall script in this directory)
# 
# NOTE: 
#   * From Yosemite OS onwards, ipfw is no logner supported so and we
#     have to use PF (pfctl) to setup firewall.
#   * In Big Sur, on boot the firewall is ignored, to make it work, 
#     You need to run 'sudo firewall stop; sudo firewall start' after booting
#

# How to install the rules to start on boot 
# -----------------------------------------
#
# To load this rules on startup, copy this file to /etc/pf.anchors and 
# edit /etc/pf.conf file and append the following lines between the 
# start/end marker at the end of the file (OR) run 'firewall_install.sh' 
# a handy script that does the same.
#
#  ---------------- start  ----------------
#   # custom firewall anchor

#   anchor "com.selvansoft"
#   load anchor "com.selvansoft" from "/etc/pf.anchors/pf_rules_simple.conf"
#  ----------------- end -----------------
# 
# NOTE: Unfortunately, apple wipes custom entries on /etc/pf.conf during every 
# MacOS update so you have to reapply the above change to /etc/pf.conf everytime 
# after any MacOS update! There is a handy script 'firewall_install.sh' which 
# can do this as well.
#
# How to Test/debug:
# -----------------
#
# testing rules: pfctl -vnf pf_rule_simple.conf
# listing rules: pfctl -sr 
# flusing rules: pfctl -F ALL
#
# debugging: we need to setup fake interface and sniff it to read logs.
#   ifconfig pflog0 create
#   /usr/sbin/tcpdump -lnettti pflog0

# NOTE: start the table with f#@!ing apple snitches i.e. ocsp.apple.com; in US/Midwest 
# it falls in the range of 17.253.3.0/24, so block the whole damn range. This will cause
# issues w/ apple services falling in the range, but who cares? For example. this will 
# break developer.apple.com that you have to temporarily allow this range to get around it
# if you really need developer.apple.com
# UPDATE (feb 15,2023): disabling this as it takes so much time to start Office 365 apps 
# as they phone home and fail taking so much time and is annoying!
