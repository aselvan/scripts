# pf_rule_simple.conf - Simple PF (packet filter) rules for basic firewall.
#
# This rule set can be used on-demand with pfctl to enable firewall 
# to protect mac while connected on a public network. There is an 
# anchor setup to allow inserting additional sources to allow trusted
# IP/CIDRs on the fly. Also, it can be installed (see install howto below)
# to start on boot. The 'firewall' shell script can be used to start/stop
# the firewall on demand (see firewall script in this directory)
# 
# NOTE: 
#   * From Yosemite OS onwards, ipfw is no logner supported so and we
#     have to use PF (pfctl) to setup firewall.
#   * In Big Sur, on boot the firewall is ignored, to make it work, 
#     You need to run 'sudo firewall stop; sudo firewall start' after booting
#
# See also: firewall, firewall_install.sh

# How to install the rules to start during OS boot time 
# -----------------------------------------------------
#
# Manual steps: 
#   * copy this file to /etc/pf.anchors/ directory
#   * edit the /etc/pf.conf file and add the lines between start & end (below) 
#     at the end of file 
#
#  ---------------- start  ----------------
#   # custom firewall anchor 
#   # Disclaimer: This is a free utility from selvansoft.com provided "as is" without 
#   # warranty of any kind, express or implied. Use it at your own risk!
#   # Source: https://github.com/aselvan/scripts/tree/master/firewall
#   anchor "com.selvansoft"
#   load anchor "com.selvansoft" from "/etc/pf.anchors/pf_rules_simple.conf"
#  ----------------- end -----------------
#
# Automated: 
#   * just run 'firewall_install.sh' - a handy script in this directory that 
#     does the same as manual steps.
#
# 
# NOTE: Unfortunately, apple wipes custom entries on /etc/pf.conf during every 
# MacOS update so you have to reapply the above change to /etc/pf.conf everytime 
# after any MacOS update! There is a handy script 'firewall_install.sh' which 
# can do this as well.

# How to Test/debug:
# -----------------
#
# testing rules: pfctl -vnf pf_rule_simple.conf
# listing rules: pfctl -sr 
# flusing rules: pfctl -F ALL
#
# debugging: we need to setup fake interface and sniff it to read logs.
#   sudo ifconfig pflog0 create
#   sudo tcpdump -lnettti pflog0

# NOTE: I had the apple snitch (i.e. ocsp.apple.com in US/Midwest) falls in 
#   the range of 17.253.3.0/24 to this before. It would prevent apple 
#   services like developer.apple.com fail but who cares? However, as of 
#   Feb 15, 2023, I removed because it takes so much time to start the 
#   MS Office 365 apps for MacOS as they seem to phone home to apple.com 
#   with multiple retries taking too much time to start, and is annoying!
# 
# For now, I just added a huge block of ChinaMobile which is a source for so 
# many compromised nodes to start with ... add more as needed in the future.
