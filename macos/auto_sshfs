# auto_sshfs: MacOS automount map for sshfs
#
# auto_sshfs --- MacOS auto mount definition for automounter for sshfs.
#
# Pre req:
#  - You must have the following packages installed for this script to work
#  - setup ssh keybased login to avoid entering password on mount
#
# brew install sshfs
#
# Setup/Install:
# 
# Copy this file to /etc & edit /etc/auto_master and add an entry as shown below
#
# /Users/arul/mnt/sshfs     /etc/auto_sshfs
# 
# The first entry above is a mount point where sshfs will be mounted under 
# using the specified 'mountname' below. The second entry is path or link
# to this file. This also needs mount_sshfs.sh script which is found in the 
# same directory as this file and should be symlinked (or copied) to /sbin  
# as shown below for ssh automount to work.
#
# ln -s mount_sshfs.sh /sbin/mount_sshfs
#
# Note: Apple makes it harder now (i.e. since Catalina update) by making /sbin 
# readonly so you have to turn off SIP in order to place this as a soft link 
# (or copy) under /sbin. 
#
# Once linked (or copied), restart the automountd like shown below
#
# sudo automount -vc
#
# Finally, when the user cd to the 'mountname', automountd will call 
# /sbin/mount_<fstype> i.e. mount_sshfs and pass on the 'hostpath' argument.
